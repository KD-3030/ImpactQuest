# How to Fix WalletConnect Errors

## The Problem
You're seeing these errors because the WalletConnect Project ID is set to a demo value that doesn't exist:
```
NEXT_PUBLIC_WALLETCONNECT_PROJECT_ID=demo-project-id-impactquest
```

## Solution 1: Get a Real Project ID (5 minutes)

### Step 1: Create a WalletConnect Cloud Account
1. Visit: https://cloud.reown.com/sign-in
2. Sign up with GitHub, Google, or Email
3. Verify your email

### Step 2: Create a New Project
1. Click "Create New Project"
2. Enter project name: **ImpactQuest**
3. Select homepage URL: **http://localhost:3000** (for development)
4. Click "Create"

### Step 3: Copy Your Project ID
1. You'll see a Project ID like: `a1b2c3d4e5f6g7h8i9j0k1l2m3n4o5p6`
2. Copy this ID

### Step 4: Update Your .env.local
```bash
# Replace the demo ID with your real ID
NEXT_PUBLIC_WALLETCONNECT_PROJECT_ID=your-actual-project-id-here
```

### Step 5: Restart Dev Server
```bash
# Stop the server (Ctrl+C)
# Start again
npm run dev
```

‚úÖ **Result**: All 403 errors will disappear!

## Solution 2: Disable WalletConnect Temporarily (Quick Fix)

If you don't want to sign up right now, you can suppress the warnings:

### Update providers.tsx
Add error suppression to the WalletConnect config:

```typescript
const wagmiConfig = createConfig({
  // ... existing config
  walletConnectOptions: {
    projectId: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_WALLETCONNECT_PROJECT_ID!,
    showQrModal: false, // Disable QR modal
    disableAnalytics: true, // Disable analytics
  },
});
```

## About the Coinbase Errors

### ERR_BLOCKED_BY_CLIENT
These are **harmless analytics/tracking requests** blocked by:
- Browser ad blockers (uBlock Origin, etc.)
- Privacy extensions
- Brave browser shields

### URLs Being Blocked:
- `cca-lite.coinbase.com/amp` - Analytics
- `cca-lite.coinbase.com/metrics` - Metrics tracking

### Why They Appear:
RainbowKit (wallet connection library) tries to load Coinbase Wallet SDK, which includes tracking.

### Fix (Optional):
If you want to remove these errors, you can disable Coinbase Wallet:

```typescript
// In app/providers.tsx
import { 
  metaMaskWallet,
  rainbowWallet,
  walletConnectWallet,
  // Remove coinbaseWallet
} from '@rainbow-me/rainbowkit/wallets';

const connectors = connectorsForWallets([
  {
    groupName: 'Popular',
    wallets: [
      metaMaskWallet,
      rainbowWallet,
      walletConnectWallet,
      // Remove coinbaseWallet from here
    ],
  },
]);
```

But honestly, **these errors don't affect functionality at all**. You can safely ignore them.
