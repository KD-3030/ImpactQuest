Once you've built your application, the final step is to deploy it so that users can access it. Since the frontend of a Celo Composer project is a standard Next.js application, you can deploy it to any platform that supports Next.js.

## Recommended Platforms

Here are some popular platforms for deploying Next.js applications:

## General Deployment Steps

While the specific steps may vary depending on the platform you choose, the general process is as follows:

1.  **Push to a Git Provider**: Push your project's code to a Git repository on a platform like GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket.

2.  **Connect Your Repository**: Connect your Git repository to your chosen deployment platform (e.g., Vercel).

3.  **Configure Build Settings**:

    - **Framework Preset**: Select `Next.js`.
    - **Build Command**: `pnpm build`.
    - **Output Directory**: `apps/web/dist` (or as configured in your `next.config.js`).
    - **Install Command**: `pnpm install`.

4.  **Set Environment Variables**: Add the environment variables from your local `.env` file to the deployment platform's settings. Make sure to use the production values for things like API keys and RPC URLs.

    <Warning>
      Never commit your `.env` file. Always use the secure environment variable
      management provided by your deployment platform.
    </Warning>

5.  **Deploy**: Trigger a new deployment. The platform will pull your code, build the application, and deploy it to a public URL.

## Deploying Smart Contracts

Your smart contracts need to be deployed to a public network (like Alfajores testnet or Celo mainnet) before your frontend application can interact with them.

- Use the `pnpm contracts:deploy:alfajores` or `pnpm contracts:deploy:celo` scripts to deploy your contracts.
- After deployment, you will get the contract addresses. You need to update your frontend's environment variables with these new addresses so it knows where to find the contracts on-chain.
