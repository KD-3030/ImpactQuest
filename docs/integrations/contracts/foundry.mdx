The Foundry template provides a complete, pre-configured environment for developing, testing, and deploying smart contracts on Celo using the Foundry toolkit.

Foundry is a blazing fast, portable, and modular toolkit for Ethereum application development written in Rust.

## How to Use

To generate a project with the Foundry template, select `foundry` when prompted for a smart contract framework, or use the `--contracts foundry` flag:

```bash
npx @celo/celo-composer@latest create my-foundry-project --contracts foundry
```

This will create a new directory at `packages/contracts` in your project, structured as a standard Foundry project.

## What's Included

The template comes with the following features and configurations out of the box:

- **Celo Network Configuration**: `foundry.toml` is pre-configured with RPC endpoints for Celo and Alfajores testnet.
- **Sample Contract**: A simple `Counter.sol` contract to get you started.
- **Deployment Scripts**: A `Counter.s.sol` script for deploying your contract using `forge script`.
- **Tests**: A `Counter.t.sol` test file with examples of how to write tests for your contract using `forge test`.
- **`.env.example`**: A template for your environment variables, including `PRIVATE_KEY` and `CELOSCAN_API_KEY`.

## Key Commands

All commands should be run from the `packages/contracts` directory.

### Compile Contracts

```bash
forge build
```

### Run Tests

```bash
forge test
```

### Deploy Contract

To deploy to a specific network, you'll need to have your `PRIVATE_KEY` set in a `.env` file.

```bash
# Deploy to Alfajores
forge script script/Counter.s.sol:CounterScript --rpc-url alfajores --broadcast --verify

# Deploy to Celo Mainnet
forge script script/Counter.s.sol:CounterScript --rpc-url mainnet --broadcast --verify
```

### Local Development with Anvil

Anvil is a local testnet node included with Foundry. You can start a local node with:

```bash
anvil
```

This will start a local chain that you can deploy to and interact with for development and testing.
