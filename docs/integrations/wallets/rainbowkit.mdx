RainbowKit is a popular, easy-to-use, and customizable wallet connector for React applications. It provides a beautiful UI for connecting to a wide range of wallets, including MetaMask, Valora, and WalletConnect-compatible wallets.

When you select RainbowKit, Celo Composer automatically installs the necessary dependencies, adds the provider components, and includes a ready-to-use `ConnectButton` in your UI.
