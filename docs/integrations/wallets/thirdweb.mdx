Thirdweb is a complete Web3 development framework that includes a powerful wallet SDK. It supports both external wallets (like MetaMask) and in-app wallets, which allow users to sign up with just an email or social account.

When you select Thirdweb, Celo Composer automatically installs the necessary dependencies, adds the provider components, and includes a ready-to-use `ConnectButton` in your UI.

## Environment Variables

To use the Thirdweb SDK, you'll need a Client ID from the Thirdweb Dashboard.

- **`NEXT_PUBLIC_THIRDWEB_CLIENT_ID`**: Your project-specific client ID.

<Info>
  You can get your free Client ID from the [Thirdweb
  Dashboard](https://thirdweb.com/dashboard/settings/api-keys).
