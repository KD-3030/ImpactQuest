Your Celo Composer project is configured primarily through environment variables. This allows you to manage sensitive information like API keys and private keys securely, without hardcoding them into your application.

## Environment Variables

When you create a new project, a `.env.example` file is generated in the root of your project. To set up your local environment, you should:

1.  **Create a copy** of this file and name it `.env`.
2.  **Fill in the required values** in the `.env` file.

```bash
# Copy the example file
cp .env.example .env
```

<Warning>
  The `.env` file contains sensitive information and is included in the `.gitignore` file by default. **Never commit your `.env` file to version control.**
</Warning>



## Build & Deployment Configuration

- **`turbo.json`**: This file configures the build pipeline for your monorepo using Turborepo. You can define the dependencies between your packages and applications here.
- **`next.config.js`**: Located in `apps/web`, this file allows you to customize the configuration for your Next.js application.

For most use cases, you won't need to modify these files, but they are available for advanced configuration if needed.
