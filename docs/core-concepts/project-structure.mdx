Celo Composer generates projects with a modern monorepo structure, designed for scalability, code sharing, and efficient development. We use PNPM workspaces and Turborepo to manage the monorepo.

Here's a typical directory layout:

```plaintext
my-celo-app/
├── apps/
│   ├── web/          # Next.js frontend application
│   └── hardhat/      # Optional: Hardhat smart contracts
├── package.json      # Root package.json
├── pnpm-workspace.yaml # Defines the workspace
└── turbo.json        # Turborepo configuration
```

## `apps` Directory

The `apps` directory contains the individual applications within your monorepo. All parts of your project, including the frontend and smart contracts, are treated as separate applications.

- **`apps/web`**: This is the main Next.js web application that serves as the user-facing frontend of your dApp.

- **`apps/hardhat`** (Optional): If you choose to include the Hardhat framework, it will be set up as a separate application here. It contains your Solidity smart contracts, deployment scripts, and tests.

## Tooling

- **PNPM Workspaces**: PNPM is used to manage dependencies and link local packages together. The `pnpm-workspace.yaml` file at the root defines which directories are part of the workspace.

- **Turborepo**: Turborepo is a high-performance build system for JavaScript and TypeScript monorepos. It speeds up your development workflow by caching build outputs and running tasks in parallel. The `turbo.json` file configures the task pipeline for your monorepo.
