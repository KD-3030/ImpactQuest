Celo Composer uses a powerful template system to let you generate projects that are tailored to your specific needs. You can choose a base template and then layer on integrations like wallet providers and smart contract frameworks.

## Base Templates

You can select a base template using the `--template` flag during project creation.

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Basic Web App" icon="globe">
    A standard Next.js 14+ web application with a modern UI, built with
    shadcn/ui and Tailwind CSS. Perfect for most dApp projects.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Minipay" icon="phone">
    A template for building dApps that integrate with the Minipay mobile wallet.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Farcaster Miniapp" icon="podcast">
    A specialized template for building Farcaster Miniapps, with Farcaster SDK
    and Frame development support pre-configured.
  </Card>
  <Card title="AI Chat" icon="bot">
    A standalone Next.js AI chat app. This template is copied as-is (raw copy),
    bypassing Handlebars/Plop rendering. Ideal when you want a complete app
    without monorepo scaffolding.
  </Card>

## Wallet Providers

Choose a wallet provider to handle user authentication and transaction signing. Use the `--wallet-provider` flag.

<CardGroup cols={3}>
  <Card title="RainbowKit" icon="rainbow">
    A popular, easy-to-use wallet connector for React apps.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Thirdweb" icon="cubes">
    A complete Web3 development framework with powerful wallet tools.
  </Card>
  <Card title="None" icon="x-circle">
    Don't include a pre-configured wallet provider. Useful if you want to
    integrate your own solution.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Smart Contract Frameworks

Celo Composer can set up a smart contract development environment for you. Use the `--contracts` flag.

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Hardhat" icon="hardhat">
    The industry-standard framework for Ethereum and EVM-compatible chains.
    Comes with a pre-configured environment for Celo networks, including
    deployment scripts and tests.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Foundry" icon="anvil">
    A fast, portable, and modular toolkit for Ethereum application development
    written in Rust. Includes Forge, Cast, Anvil, and Chisel.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## How it Works

When you run `celo-composer create`, the CLI uses Plop.js to dynamically generate the project files based on your selections. It copies the base template and then conditionally adds the files and configurations for your chosen integrations.

Note: The `ai-chat` template uses a raw copy path (no Plop). Unwanted files (like `.env`, `.next`, `node_modules`, `artifacts`) are filtered out automatically during copy.

This approach ensures that your project only includes the code it needs, keeping it clean and optimized.
