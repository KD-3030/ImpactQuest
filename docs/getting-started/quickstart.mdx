This guide will walk you through creating a new Celo project, understanding its structure, and running it locally.

## 1. Create a New Project

To create a new project, open your terminal and run:

```bash
npx @celo/celo-composer@latest create my-celo-app
```

The CLI will guide you through a series of prompts to configure your project. For this quick start, you can accept the default options by pressing `Enter` for each prompt.

<Info>
  **Pro Tip:** You can also run `npx @celo/celo-composer@latest create my-celo-app --yes` to skip all prompts and use the default settings automatically.
</Info>

## 2. Navigate to Your Project

Once the project is created, navigate into the project directory:

```bash
cd my-celo-app
```

## 3. Run the Development Server

To start the local development server, run the following command:

```bash
pnpm dev
```

This will start the frontend application on `http://localhost:3000`. Open this URL in your browser to see your new Celo dApp in action!

## Project Structure Overview

Your new project has a monorepo structure, managed by Turborepo. Here's a quick look at the key directories:

- **`apps/web`**: This is your Next.js frontend application.
- **`apps/hardhat`**: If you chose to include a smart contract framework like Hardhat, your contracts and tests will be located here.
