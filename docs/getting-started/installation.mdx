## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following installed on your system:

- **Node.js**: Version 18.0 or higher. You can download it from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).
- **PNPM**: We recommend using PNPM as the package manager for your projects. You can install it with:
  ```bash
  npm install -g pnpm
  ```

Celo Composer is a command-line tool that you can run directly using `npx`, which is included with Node.js. This allows you to use the CLI without needing to install it globally on your machine.

### How to Run

To use Celo Composer, you will run the `create` command using `npx`. This tool will always use the latest version of Celo Composer available.

```bash
npx @celo/celo-composer@latest create
```

This command will initiate the project creation process, guiding you through the setup of your new Celo dApp.

## Next Steps

Now that you know how to run Celo Composer, you're ready to create your first project. Head over to the **[Quick Start](/getting-started/quickstart)** guide to get started.
