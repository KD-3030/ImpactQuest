## Browser Console - What You Should See:

### ‚úÖ Good (Expected):
```
‚úì MongoDB connected successfully
‚úì Compiled / in Xms
‚úì Ready in Xs
```

### ‚ö†Ô∏è OK (Non-Breaking Warnings):
```
‚ö† [Reown Config] Using local/default values
‚ö† Multiple versions of Lit loaded
‚ö† WalletConnect Core initialized 2 times
```

### ‚ùå Bad (Should NOT See):
```
‚ùå TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined
‚ùå ReferenceError: X is not defined
‚ùå Module not found
‚ùå Failed to compile
```

## If You Still See Errors:

### Step 1: Hard Refresh
1. Open browser console (F12)
2. Right-click the refresh button
3. Select "Empty Cache and Hard Reload"

### Step 2: Clear Build Cache
```bash
rm -rf .next
npm run dev
```

### Step 3: Check Browser Extensions
Temporarily disable:
- Ad blockers (uBlock Origin, AdBlock)
- Privacy extensions (Privacy Badger)
- Script blockers

### Step 4: Check Environment Variables
Verify `.env.local` has:
```bash
MONGODB_URI=mongodb+srv://...
NEXT_PUBLIC_WALLETCONNECT_PROJECT_ID=demo-project-id-impactquest
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL=http://localhost:3000
NEXT_PUBLIC_CONTRACT_ADDRESS=0xF0b27F5d830238B392D2002ADaC26E67A9A96510
```

## Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: "Back to Home" button doesn't work
**Solution**: Check that the router is working:
```typescript
// Should be in Sidebar.tsx and login page
const router = useRouter();
router.push('/');
```
**Status**: ‚úÖ Already implemented

### Issue: Console still showing errors
**Solution**: 
1. These are likely from browser extensions
2. Check if functionality works despite errors
3. If app works ‚Üí errors are safe to ignore
4. If app breaks ‚Üí report specific error

### Issue: Wallet won't connect
**Solution**:
1. Check MetaMask/wallet is installed
2. Refresh the page
3. Try different wallet provider
4. Check network is set to Celo/Celo Alfajores

## Production Deployment Checklist
