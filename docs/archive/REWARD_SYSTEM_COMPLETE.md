## 💰 Reward Economics

### Token Earning

| Stage | Points Needed | Quest Tokens | Stage Upgrade Bonus | Discount Rate |
|-------|---------------|--------------|---------------------|---------------|
| Seedling | 0-99 | 1 token | - | 10% |
| Sprout | 100-299 | 2 tokens | 10 tokens | 15% |
| Tree | 300-599 | 3 tokens | 20 tokens | 20% |
| Forest | 600+ | 5 tokens | 50 tokens | 25% |

### Additional Bonuses
- **High-Impact Quests**: +1 token for quests ≥100 points
- **Creator Rewards**: 5% of quest points (min 1, max 10 tokens) per completion

### Redemption
- **Conversion**: 1 token = 1 cUSD discount
- **Calculation**: Discount Amount = Purchase Amount × Discount Rate
- **Validation**: Must have sufficient tokens and meet shop stage requirement
