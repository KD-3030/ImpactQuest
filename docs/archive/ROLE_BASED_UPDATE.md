### Setting Admin Addresses

Edit `/lib/auth-context.tsx`:

```typescript
const ADMIN_ADDRESSES = [

3. **No Submission Review UI**: Endpoint exists, UI coming soon
4. **Role in LocalStorage**: Not encrypted (use JWT in production)
5. **No Rate Limiting**: Add for production

---

## 🔒 Security Notes

### Current Implementation
- ⚠️ Roles stored in localStorage (client-side)
- ⚠️ No API middleware to verify admin role
- ⚠️ Admin addresses hardcoded (okay for MVP)

### For Production
- ✅ Implement JWT tokens for role verification
- ✅ Add API middleware to check admin permissions
- ✅ Store admin addresses in database
- ✅ Add rate limiting to admin endpoints
- ✅ Implement proper session management
- ✅ Add CSRF protection

---

## 📊 Database Changes

No schema changes needed! All existing functionality works with:
- User model
- Quest model
- Submission model

New queries added for admin endpoints:
- Fetch all submissions with populated refs
- Fetch all users with aggregated stats
- Update quest by ID
- Delete quest by ID

---

## 🎨 Design Decisions

### Why Separate Dashboards?

- Different mental models for admin vs user
- Easier to maintain and scale
- Better UX for each role

### Why Sidebar?

- Easy navigation between pages
- Always visible on desktop
- Space-efficient on mobile

### Why Role Selection Page?
- User choice and flexibility
- Clear onboarding flow
- Can support multiple roles per user
- Easy to extend with more roles

### Why LocalStorage for Roles?
- Fast and simple for MVP
- No backend session management needed
- Works with wallet-based auth
- Easy to upgrade to JWT later
