## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Data Flow
1. User connects wallet
2. Component fetches submissions via API
3. Data filtered by selected tab
4. Cards rendered with animations
5. Click handlers for image preview and navigation

### State Management
```typescript
const [submissions, setSubmissions] = useState<Submission[]>([]);
const [loading, setLoading] = useState(true);
const [filter, setFilter] = useState<'all' | 'verified' | 'pending'>('all');
const [previewImage, setPreviewImage] = useState<string | null>(null);
```

### Category Color Mapping
```typescript
const getCategoryColor = (category: string) => {
  const colors = {
    cleanup: 'primary',
    planting: 'success',
    recycling: 'secondary',
    education: 'warning',
    other: 'primary',
  };
  return colors[category] || 'primary';
};
```

## 📊 Stats Calculations

### Real-time Computed Values
```typescript
const verifiedCount = submissions.filter(s => s.verified).length;
const pendingCount = submissions.filter(s => !s.verified).length;
const totalPoints = submissions.reduce((sum, s) => sum + s.impactPointsEarned, 0);
```
