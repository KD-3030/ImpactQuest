## What Was Built

### 1. **User Rewards Dashboard** 🎁
**Location:** `/dashboard/rewards`

#### Features:
The page uses the existing `RewardsDashboard` component which displays:

- **Personal Statistics Cards**
  - Available Tokens (current balance)
  - Current Stage with emoji (🌱🌿🌳🌲)

  - Color-coded (green for earned, red for spent)

- **Quick Action Buttons**
  - "Browse Shops" - Navigate to shop redemption page
  - "Complete Quests" - Navigate to quest browsing
  - Animated hover effects with gradients

#### Technical Details:

- Fetches data from `/api/rewards` endpoint
- Gradient background matching app theme
- Fully responsive design

### 2. **User Rewards API Endpoint** 🔌
**Location:** `/api/user/rewards/transactions`

#### Purpose:
Fetch personalized reward transaction history for authenticated users.

#### Method: GET

#### Query Parameters:
- `walletAddress` (required) - User's wallet address
- `limit` (optional) - Number of transactions to return (default: 50)

#### Response Format:
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "transactions": [
    {
      "_id": "...",
      "type": "quest_completion",
      "amount": 10,
      "description": "Completed Beach Cleanup Quest",
      "walletAddress": "0x...",
      "createdAt": "2025-10-26T10:30:00.000Z"
    }
  ]
}
```

#### Transaction Types:
- `quest_completion` - Tokens earned from completing quests
- `stage_upgrade` - Bonus tokens from stage progression
- `creator_reward` - Tokens earned from creating quests
- `redemption` - Tokens spent at shops (negative amount)
- `redemption_refund` - Tokens refunded from cancelled redemptions

#### Security:
- Requires wallet address authentication
- Only returns user's own transactions
- Validates user exists in database
- Returns 400 if wallet address missing
- Returns 404 if user not found

#### Technical Implementation:
- Connects to MongoDB via `connectDB()`
- Uses lean queries for performance
- Sorts by `createdAt` descending (newest first)
- Imports models from `@/models` index
