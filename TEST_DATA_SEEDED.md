## Real-Time Updates & Performance

### ‚úÖ API Optimization Active
All API routes are using:
- **In-memory caching** (30-60 second TTL)
- **Database indexes** for fast queries
- **Lean queries** (plain objects, not Mongoose documents)
- **Field selection** (only fetching needed data)
- **Pagination** support

### üîÑ Polling-Based Auto-Refresh
Admin pages auto-refresh every **30 seconds** using `setInterval`:
- Admin Dashboard ‚Üí Fetches users, quests, submissions
- Manage Quests ‚Üí Fetches quest list
- Cache hits show "Returning cached..." in terminal logs

### üìä Terminal Logs Show:
```
‚úÖ MongoDB connected successfully
GET /api/admin/users 200 in 2686ms
GET /api/quests 200 in 3079ms
GET /api/admin/submissions 200 in 3127ms
Returning cached user stats
GET /api/admin/users 200 in 30ms
```

**First load:** ~2-3 seconds (database query)  
**Cached requests:** ~20-50ms (in-memory cache)

```

The script will:
1. Connect to MongoDB (using .env.local)
2. Clear existing quests, shops, and redemptions
3. Create 8 new quests
4. Create 6 new local shops
5. Create 1 test user (if doesn't exist)
6. Create 3 redemptions for the test user

### Cached Requests
- All APIs: 20-50ms (98% faster!)

### Auto-Refresh
- Interval: 30 seconds

## Troubleshooting

### If quests don't appear on map:
1. Check browser console for errors
2. Verify MongoDB connection in terminal
3. Clear browser cache and refresh
4. Check /api/quests endpoint directly

### If caching not working:
1. Check terminal logs for "Returning cached..." messages
2. Verify lib/cache.ts is being used
3. Wait 30-60 seconds for first cache to populate

### If polling not working:
1. Open browser DevTools ‚Üí Network tab
2. Should see API calls every 30 seconds
3. Check admin page console for intervals
